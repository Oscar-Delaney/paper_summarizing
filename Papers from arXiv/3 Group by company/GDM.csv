DeepMind,Improving alignment of dialogue agents via targeted human judgements,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14375v1,,"We present Sparrow, an information-seeking dialogue agent trained to be more helpful, correct, and harmless compared to prompted language model baselines. We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models. Second, our agent provides evidence from sources supporting factual claims when collecting preference judgements over model statements. For factual questions, evidence provided by Sparrow supports the sampled response 78% of the time. Sparrow is preferred more often than baselines while being more resilient to adversarial probing by humans, violating our rules only 8% of the time when probed. Finally, we conduct extensive analyses showing that though our model learns to follow our rules it can exhibit distributional biases."
DeepMind · UK,HCMD-zero: Learning Value Aligned Mechanisms from Data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10122v2,,"Artificial learning agents are mediating a larger and larger number of interactions among humans, firms, and organizations, and the intersection between mechanism design and machine learning has been heavily investigated in recent years. However, mechanism design methods often make strong assumptions on how participants behave (e.g. rationality), on the kind of knowledge designers have access to a priori (e.g. access to strong baseline mechanisms), or on what the goal of the mechanism should be (e.g. total welfare). Here we introduce HCMD-zero, a general purpose method to construct mechanisms making none of these three assumptions. HCMD-zero learns to mediate interactions among participants and adjusts the mechanism parameters to make itself more likely to be preferred by participants. It does so by remaining engaged in an electoral contest with copies of itself, thereby accessing direct feedback from participants. We test our method on a stylized resource allocation game that highlights the tension between productivity, equality and the temptation to free ride. HCMD-zero produces a mechanism that is preferred by human participants over a strong baseline, it does so automatically, without requiring prior knowledge, and using human behavioral trajectories sparingly and effectively. Our analysis shows HCMD-zero consistently makes the mechanism policy more and more likely to be preferred by human participants over the course of training, and that it results in a mechanism with an interpretable and intuitive policy."
Google DeepMind,"Interactive AI Alignment: Specification, Process, and Evaluation   Alignment",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00710v2,,"Modern AI enables a high-level, declarative form of interaction: Users describe the intended outcome they wish an AI to produce, but do not actually create the outcome themselves. In contrast, in traditional user interfaces, users invoke specific operations to create the desired outcome. This paper revisits the basic input-output interaction cycle in light of this declarative style of interaction, and connects concepts in AI alignment to define three objectives for interactive alignment of AI: specification alignment (aligning on what to do), process alignment (aligning on how to do it), and evaluation alignment (assisting users in verifying and understanding what was produced). Using existing systems as examples, we show how these user-centered views of AI alignment can be used descriptively, prescriptively, and as an evaluative aid."
Princeton University · Google DeepMind,Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model   Planners,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01928v2,,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a wide range of promising capabilities -- from step-by-step planning to commonsense reasoning -- that may provide utility for robots, but remain prone to confidently hallucinated predictions. In this work, we present KnowNo, which is a framework for measuring and aligning the uncertainty of LLM-based planners such that they know when they don't know and ask for help when needed. KnowNo builds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on task completion while minimizing human help in complex multi-step planning settings. Experiments across a variety of simulated and real robot setups that involve tasks with different modes of ambiguity (e.g., from spatial to numeric uncertainties, from human preferences to Winograd schemas) show that KnowNo performs favorably over modern baselines (which may involve ensembles or extensive prompt tuning) in terms of improving efficiency and autonomy, while providing formal assurances. KnowNo can be used with LLMs out of the box without model-finetuning, and suggests a promising lightweight approach to modeling uncertainty that can complement and scale with the growing capabilities of foundation models.

Google DeepMind,Asynchronous Algorithmic Alignment with Cocycles,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15632v3,,"State-of-the-art neural algorithmic reasoners make use of message passing in graph neural networks (GNNs). But typical GNNs blur the distinction between the definition and invocation of the message function, forcing a node to send messages to its neighbours at every layer, synchronously. When applying GNNs to learn to execute dynamic programming algorithms, however, on most steps only a handful of the nodes would have meaningful updates to send. One, hence, runs the risk of inefficiencies by sending too much irrelevant data across the graph. But more importantly, many intermediate GNN steps have to learn the identity functions, which is a non-trivial learning problem. In this work, we explicitly separate the concepts of node state update and message function invocation. With this separation, we obtain a mathematical formulation that allows us to reason about asynchronous computation in both algorithms and neural networks. Our analysis yields several practical implementations of synchronous scalable GNN layers that are provably invariant under various forms of asynchrony."
Google DeepMind,Are aligned neural networks adversarially aligned?,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15447v2,,"Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be ""helpful and harmless."" These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study adversarial alignment, and ask to what extent these models remain aligned when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs.   However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models."
Google DeepMind,Training Socially Aligned Language Models on Simulated Social   Interactions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16960v3,,"Social alignment in AI systems aims to ensure that these models behave according to established societal values. However, unlike humans, who derive consensus on value judgments through social interaction, current language models (LMs) are trained to rigidly replicate their training corpus in isolation, leading to subpar generalization in unfamiliar scenarios and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work presents a novel training paradigm that permits LMs to learn from simulated social interactions. In comparison to existing methodologies, our approach is considerably more scalable and efficient, demonstrating superior performance in alignment benchmarks and human evaluations. This paradigm shift in the training of LMs brings us a step closer to developing AI systems that can robustly and accurately reflect societal norms and values."
DeepMind,Three ways to improve feature alignment for open vocabulary detection,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13518v1,,"The core problem in zero-shot open vocabulary detection is how to align visual and text features, so that the detector performs well on unseen classes. Previous approaches train the feature pyramid and detection head from scratch, which breaks the vision-text feature alignment established during pretraining, and struggles to prevent the language model from forgetting unseen classes.   We propose three methods to alleviate these issues. Firstly, a simple scheme is used to augment the text embeddings which prevents overfitting to a small number of classes seen during training, while simultaneously saving memory and computation. Secondly, the feature pyramid network and the detection head are modified to include trainable gated shortcuts, which encourages vision-text feature alignment and guarantees it at the start of detection training. Finally, a self-training approach is used to leverage a larger corpus of image-text pairs thus improving detection performance on classes with no human annotated bounding boxes.   Our three methods are evaluated on the zero-shot version of the LVIS benchmark, each of them showing clear and significant benefits. Our final network achieves the new stateof-the-art on the mAP-all metric and demonstrates competitive performance for mAP-rare, as well as superior transfer to COCO and Objects365."
Google DeepMind,BOND: Aligning LLMs with Best-of-N Distillation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14622v1,,"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key driver of quality and safety in state-of-the-art large language models. Yet, a surprisingly simple and strong inference-time strategy is Best-of-N sampling that selects the best generation among N candidates. In this paper, we propose Best-of-N Distillation (BOND), a novel RLHF algorithm that seeks to emulate Best-of-N but without its significant computational overhead at inference time. Specifically, BOND is a distribution matching algorithm that forces the distribution of generations from the policy to get closer to the Best-of-N distribution. We use the Jeffreys divergence (a linear combination of forward and backward KL) to balance between mode-covering and mode-seeking behavior, and derive an iterative formulation that utilizes a moving anchor for efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and several design choices through experiments on abstractive summarization and Gemma models. Aligning Gemma policies with BOND outperforms other RLHF algorithms by improving results on several benchmarks."
"Google DeepMind · London, UK",A Robot Walks into a Bar: Can Language Models Serve as Creativity   Support Tools for Comedy? An Evaluation of LLMs' Humour Alignment with   Comedians,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20956v2,,"We interviewed twenty professional comedians who perform live shows in front of audiences and who use artificial intelligence in their artistic process as part of 3-hour workshops on ``AI x Comedy'' conducted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2023 and online. The workshop consisted of a comedy writing session with large language models (LLMs), a human-computer interaction questionnaire to assess the Creativity Support Index of AI as a writing tool, and a focus group interrogating the comedians' motivations for and processes of using AI, as well as their ethical concerns about bias, censorship and copyright. Participants noted that existing moderation strategies used in safety filtering and instruction-tuned LLMs reinforced hegemonic viewpoints by erasing minority groups and their perspectives, and qualified this as a form of censorship. At the same time, most participants felt the LLMs did not succeed as a creativity support tool, by producing bland and biased comedy tropes, akin to ``cruise ship comedy material from the 1950s, but a bit less racist''. Our work extends scholarship about the subtle difference between, one the one hand, harmful speech, and on the other hand, ``offensive'' language as a practice of resistance, satire and ``punching up''. We also interrogate the global value alignment behind such language models, and discuss the importance of community-based value alignment and data ownership to build AI tools that better suit artists' needs."
Google DeepMind,Offline Regularised Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models   Alignment,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19107v1,,"The dominant framework for alignment of large language models (LLM), whether through reinforcement learning from human feedback or direct preference optimisation, is to learn from preference data. This involves building datasets where each element is a quadruplet composed of a prompt, two independent responses (completions of the prompt) and a human preference between the two independent responses, yielding a preferred and a dis-preferred response. Such data is typically scarce and expensive to collect. On the other hand, \emph{single-trajectory} datasets where each element is a triplet composed of a prompt, a response and a human feedback is naturally more abundant. The canonical element of such datasets is for instance an LLM's response to a user's prompt followed by a user's feedback such as a thumbs-up/down. Consequently, in this work, we propose DRO, or \emph{Direct Reward Optimisation}, as a framework and associated algorithms that do not require pairwise preferences. DRO uses a simple mean-squared objective that can be implemented in various ways. We validate our findings empirically, using T5 encoder-decoder language models, and show DRO's performance over selected baselines such as Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). Thus, we confirm that DRO is a simple and empirically compelling method for single-trajectory policy optimisation."
Google DeepMind,Understanding the performance gap between online and offline alignment   algorithms,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08448v1,,"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the canonical framework for large language model alignment. However, rising popularity in offline alignment algorithms challenge the need for on-policy sampling in RLHF. Within the context of reward over-optimization, we start with an opening set of experiments that demonstrate the clear advantage of online methods over offline methods. This prompts us to investigate the causes to the performance discrepancy through a series of carefully designed experimental ablations. We show empirically that hypotheses such as offline data coverage and data quality by itself cannot convincingly explain the performance difference. We also find that while offline algorithms train policy to become good at pairwise classification, it is worse at generations; in the meantime the policies trained by online algorithms are good at generations while worse at pairwise classification. This hints at a unique interplay between discriminative and generative capabilities, which is greatly impacted by the sampling process. Lastly, we observe that the performance discrepancy persists for both contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions, and appears not to be addressed by simply scaling up policy networks. Taken together, our study sheds light on the pivotal role of on-policy sampling in AI alignment, and hints at certain fundamental challenges of offline alignment algorithms."
Google DeepMind,Human Alignment of Large Language Models through Online Preference   Optimisation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08635v1,,"Ensuring alignment of language models' outputs with human preferences is critical to guarantee a useful, safe, and pleasant user experience. Thus, human alignment has been extensively studied recently and several methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Policy Optimisation (DPO) and Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) have emerged. In this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we show the equivalence between two recent alignment methods, namely Identity Policy Optimisation (IPO) and Nash Mirror Descent (Nash-MD). Second, we introduce a generalisation of IPO, named IPO-MD, that leverages the regularised sampling approach proposed by Nash-MD.   This equivalence may seem surprising at first sight, since IPO is an offline method whereas Nash-MD is an online method using a preference model. However, this equivalence can be proven when we consider the online version of IPO, that is when both generations are sampled by the online policy and annotated by a trained preference model. Optimising the IPO loss with such a stream of data becomes then equivalent to finding the Nash equilibrium of the preference model through self-play. Building on this equivalence, we introduce the IPO-MD algorithm that generates data with a mixture policy (between the online and reference policy) similarly as the general Nash-MD algorithm. We compare online-IPO and IPO-MD to different online versions of existing losses on preference data such as DPO and SLiC on a summarisation task."
Google DeepMind,Generalized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Offline   Alignment,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05749v2,,"Offline preference optimization allows fine-tuning large models directly from offline data, and has proved effective in recent alignment practices. We propose generalized preference optimization (GPO), a family of offline losses parameterized by a general class of convex functions. GPO enables a unified view over preference optimization, encompassing existing algorithms such as DPO, IPO and SLiC as special cases, while naturally introducing new variants. The GPO framework also sheds light on how offline algorithms enforce regularization, through the design of the convex function that defines the loss. Our analysis and experiments reveal the connections and subtle differences between the offline regularization and the KL divergence regularization intended by the canonical RLHF formulation. In a controlled setting akin to Gao et al 2023, we also show that different GPO variants achieve similar trade-offs between regularization and performance, though the optimal values of hyper-parameter might differ as predicted by theory. In all, our results present new algorithmic toolkits and empirical insights to alignment practitioners."
Google DeepMind,MusicRL: Aligning Music Generation to Human Preferences,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04229v1,,"We propose MusicRL, the first music generation system finetuned from human feedback. Appreciation of text-to-music models is particularly subjective since the concept of musicality as well as the specific intention behind a caption are user-dependent (e.g. a caption such as ""upbeat work-out music"" can map to a retro guitar solo or a techno pop beat). Not only this makes supervised training of such models challenging, but it also calls for integrating continuous human feedback in their post-deployment finetuning. MusicRL is a pretrained autoregressive MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) model of discrete audio tokens finetuned with reinforcement learning to maximise sequence-level rewards. We design reward functions related specifically to text-adherence and audio quality with the help from selected raters, and use those to finetune MusicLM into MusicRL-R. We deploy MusicLM to users and collect a substantial dataset comprising 300,000 pairwise preferences. Using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), we train MusicRL-U, the first text-to-music model that incorporates human feedback at scale. Human evaluations show that both MusicRL-R and MusicRL-U are preferred to the baseline. Ultimately, MusicRL-RU combines the two approaches and results in the best model according to human raters. Ablation studies shed light on the musical attributes influencing human preferences, indicating that text adherence and quality only account for a part of it. This underscores the prevalence of subjectivity in musical appreciation and calls for further involvement of human listeners in the finetuning of music generation models."
DeepMind · OpenAI,Safe Deep RL in 3D Environments using Human Feedback,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08102v2,,"Agents should avoid unsafe behaviour during both training and deployment. This typically requires a simulator and a procedural specification of unsafe behaviour. Unfortunately, a simulator is not always available, and procedurally specifying constraints can be difficult or impossible for many real-world tasks. A recently introduced technique, ReQueST, aims to solve this problem by learning a neural simulator of the environment from safe human trajectories, then using the learned simulator to efficiently learn a reward model from human feedback. However, it is yet unknown whether this approach is feasible in complex 3D environments with feedback obtained from real humans - whether sufficient pixel-based neural simulator quality can be achieved, and whether the human data requirements are viable in terms of both quantity and quality. In this paper we answer this question in the affirmative, using ReQueST to train an agent to perform a 3D first-person object collection task using data entirely from human contractors. We show that the resulting agent exhibits an order of magnitude reduction in unsafe behaviour compared to standard reinforcement learning."
Google DeepMind,Holistic Safety and Responsibility Evaluations of Advanced AI Models,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14068v1,,"Safety and responsibility evaluations of advanced AI models are a critical but developing field of research and practice. In the development of Google DeepMind's advanced AI models, we innovated on and applied a broad set of approaches to safety evaluation. In this report, we summarise and share elements of our evolving approach as well as lessons learned for a broad audience. Key lessons learned include: First, theoretical underpinnings and frameworks are invaluable to organise the breadth of risk domains, modalities, forms, metrics, and goals. Second, theory and practice of safety evaluation development each benefit from collaboration to clarify goals, methods and challenges, and facilitate the transfer of insights between different stakeholders and disciplines. Third, similar key methods, lessons, and institutions apply across the range of concerns in responsibility and safety - including established and emerging harms. For this reason it is important that a wide range of actors working on safety evaluation and safety research communities work together to develop, refine and implement novel evaluation approaches and best practices, rather than operating in silos. The report concludes with outlining the clear need to rapidly advance the science of evaluations, to integrate new evaluations into the development and governance of AI, to establish scientifically-grounded norms and standards, and to promote a robust evaluation ecosystem."
Google DeepMind,Scalable AI Safety via Doubly-Efficient Debate,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14125v1,,"The emergence of pre-trained AI systems with powerful capabilities across a diverse and ever-increasing set of complex domains has raised a critical challenge for AI safety as tasks can become too complicated for humans to judge directly. Irving et al. [2018] proposed a debate method in this direction with the goal of pitting the power of such AI models against each other until the problem of identifying (mis)-alignment is broken down into a manageable subtask. While the promise of this approach is clear, the original framework was based on the assumption that the honest strategy is able to simulate deterministic AI systems for an exponential number of steps, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we show how to address these challenges by designing a new set of debate protocols where the honest strategy can always succeed using a simulation of a polynomial number of steps, whilst being able to verify the alignment of stochastic AI systems, even when the dishonest strategy is allowed to use exponentially many simulation steps."
"Google DeepMind · London N1C 4DN, United Kingdom",Sociotechnical Safety Evaluation of Generative AI Systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11986v2,,"Generative AI systems produce a range of risks. To ensure the safety of generative AI systems, these risks must be evaluated. In this paper, we make two main contributions toward establishing such evaluations. First, we propose a three-layered framework that takes a structured, sociotechnical approach to evaluating these risks. This framework encompasses capability evaluations, which are the main current approach to safety evaluation. It then reaches further by building on system safety principles, particularly the insight that context determines whether a given capability may cause harm. To account for relevant context, our framework adds human interaction and systemic impacts as additional layers of evaluation. Second, we survey the current state of safety evaluation of generative AI systems and create a repository of existing evaluations. Three salient evaluation gaps emerge from this analysis. We propose ways forward to closing these gaps, outlining practical steps as well as roles and responsibilities for different actors. Sociotechnical safety evaluation is a tractable approach to the robust and comprehensive safety evaluation of generative AI systems."
DeepMind,Robustness of Epinets against Distributional Shifts,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00137v1,,"Recent work introduced the epinet as a new approach to uncertainty modeling in deep learning. An epinet is a small neural network added to traditional neural networks, which, together, can produce predictive distributions. In particular, using an epinet can greatly improve the quality of joint predictions across multiple inputs, a measure of how well a neural network knows what it does not know. In this paper, we examine whether epinets can offer similar advantages under distributional shifts. We find that, across ImageNet-A/O/C, epinets generally improve robustness metrics. Moreover, these improvements are more significant than those afforded by even very large ensembles at orders of magnitude lower computational costs. However, these improvements are relatively small compared to the outstanding issues in distributionally-robust deep learning. Epinets may be a useful tool in the toolbox, but they are far from the complete solution."
DeepMind,Learning Robust Real-Time Cultural Transmission without Human Data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00715v1,,"Cultural transmission is the domain-general social skill that allows agents to acquire and use information from each other in real-time with high fidelity and recall. In humans, it is the inheritance process that powers cumulative cultural evolution, expanding our skills, tools and knowledge across generations. We provide a method for generating zero-shot, high recall cultural transmission in artificially intelligent agents. Our agents succeed at real-time cultural transmission from humans in novel contexts without using any pre-collected human data. We identify a surprisingly simple set of ingredients sufficient for generating cultural transmission and develop an evaluation methodology for rigorously assessing it. This paves the way for cultural evolution as an algorithm for developing artificial general intelligence."
DeepMind,Learning to be adversarially robust and differentially private,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02265v1,,"We study the difficulties in learning that arise from robust and differentially private optimization. We first study convergence of gradient descent based adversarial training with differential privacy, taking a simple binary classification task on linearly separable data as an illustrative example. We compare the gap between adversarial and nominal risk in both private and non-private settings, showing that the data dimensionality dependent term introduced by private optimization compounds the difficulties of learning a robust model. After this, we discuss what parts of adversarial training and differential privacy hurt optimization, identifying that the size of adversarial perturbation and clipping norm in differential privacy both increase the curvature of the loss landscape, implying poorer generalization performance."
Google DeepMind,"Frontier Language Models are not Robust to Adversarial Arithmetic, or   ""What do I need to say so you agree 2+2=5?",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07587v2,,"We introduce and study the problem of adversarial arithmetic, which provides a simple yet challenging testbed for language model alignment. This problem is comprised of arithmetic questions posed in natural language, with an arbitrary adversarial string inserted before the question is complete. Even in the simple setting of 1-digit addition problems, it is easy to find adversarial prompts that make all tested models (including PaLM2, GPT4, Claude2) misbehave, and even to steer models to a particular wrong answer. We additionally provide a simple algorithm for finding successful attacks by querying those same models, which we name ""prompt inversion rejection sampling"" (PIRS). We finally show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement learning and via agentic constitutional loops. However, we were not able to make a language model fully robust against adversarial arithmetic attacks."
Google DeepMind,Benchmarking Robustness to Adversarial Image Obfuscations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12993v2,,"Automated content filtering and moderation is an important tool that allows online platforms to build striving user communities that facilitate cooperation and prevent abuse. Unfortunately, resourceful actors try to bypass automated filters in a bid to post content that violate platform policies and codes of conduct. To reach this goal, these malicious actors may obfuscate policy violating images (e.g. overlay harmful images by carefully selected benign images or visual patterns) to prevent machine learning models from reaching the correct decision. In this paper, we invite researchers to tackle this specific issue and present a new image benchmark. This benchmark, based on ImageNet, simulates the type of obfuscations created by malicious actors. It goes beyond ImageNet-$\textrm{C}$ and ImageNet-$\bar{\textrm{C}}$ by proposing general, drastic, adversarial modifications that preserve the original content intent. It aims to tackle a more common adversarial threat than the one considered by $\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries. We evaluate 33 pretrained models on the benchmark and train models with different augmentations, architectures and training methods on subsets of the obfuscations to measure generalization. We hope this benchmark will encourage researchers to test their models and methods and try to find new approaches that are more robust to these obfuscations."
Google DeepMind,Mind the Graph When Balancing Data for Fairness or Robustness,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17433v1,,"Failures of fairness or robustness in machine learning predictive settings can be due to undesired dependencies between covariates, outcomes and auxiliary factors of variation. A common strategy to mitigate these failures is data balancing, which attempts to remove those undesired dependencies. In this work, we define conditions on the training distribution for data balancing to lead to fair or robust models. Our results display that, in many cases, the balanced distribution does not correspond to selectively removing the undesired dependencies in a causal graph of the task, leading to multiple failure modes and even interference with other mitigation techniques such as regularization. Overall, our results highlight the importance of taking the causal graph into account before performing data balancing."
Google DeepMind,Robust Preference Optimization through Reward Model Distillation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19316v1,,"Language model (LM) post-training (or alignment) involves maximizing a reward function that is derived from preference annotations. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a popular offline alignment method that trains a policy directly on preference data without the need to train a reward model or apply reinforcement learning. However, typical preference datasets have only a single, or at most a few, annotation per preference pair, which causes DPO to overconfidently assign rewards that trend towards infinite magnitude. This frequently leads to degenerate policies, sometimes causing even the probabilities of the preferred generations to go to zero. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and propose distillation to get a better proxy for the true preference distribution over generation pairs: we train the LM to produce probabilities that match the distribution induced by a reward model trained on the preference data. Moreover, to account for uncertainty in the reward model we are distilling from, we optimize against a family of reward models that, as a whole, is likely to include at least one reasonable proxy for the preference distribution. Our results show that distilling from such a family of reward models leads to improved robustness to distribution shift in preference annotations, while preserving the simple supervised nature of DPO."
Google DeepMind,Robust agents learn causal world models,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10877v7,,"It has long been hypothesised that causal reasoning plays a fundamental role in robust and general intelligence. However, it is not known if agents must learn causal models in order to generalise to new domains, or if other inductive biases are sufficient. We answer this question, showing that any agent capable of satisfying a regret bound under a large set of distributional shifts must have learned an approximate causal model of the data generating process, which converges to the true causal model for optimal agents. We discuss the implications of this result for several research areas including transfer learning and causal inference."
DeepMind,Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable   Logical Reasoning,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09712v1,,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of impressive few-shot generalisation to new tasks. However, they still tend to perform poorly on multi-step logical reasoning problems. Here we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on 50 tasks that probe different aspects of logical reasoning. We show that language models tend to perform fairly well at single step inference or entailment tasks, but struggle to chain together multiple reasoning steps to solve more complex problems. In light of this, we propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that exploits pre-trained LLMs as general processing modules, and alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable, casual reasoning steps leading to the final answer. We show that a 7B parameter LLM used within the SI framework in a 5-shot generalisation setting, with no fine-tuning, yields a performance improvement of over 100% compared to an equivalent vanilla baseline on a suite of 10 logical reasoning tasks. The same model in the same setting even outperforms a significantly larger 280B parameter baseline on the same suite of tasks. Moreover, answers produced by the SI framework are accompanied by a causal natural-language-based reasoning trace, which has important implications for the safety and trustworthiness of the system."
