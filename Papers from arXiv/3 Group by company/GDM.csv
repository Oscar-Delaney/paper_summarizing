Google Research,Style Aligned Image Generation via Shared Attention,04-Dec-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02133v2,,"Large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) models have rapidly gained prominence across creative fields, generating visually compelling outputs from textual prompts. However, controlling these models to ensure consistent style remains challenging, with existing methods necessitating fine-tuning and manual intervention to disentangle content and style. In this paper, we introduce StyleAligned, a novel technique designed to establish style alignment among a series of generated images. By employing minimal `attention sharing' during the diffusion process, our method maintains style consistency across images within T2I models. This approach allows for the creation of style-consistent images using a reference style through a straightforward inversion operation. Our method's evaluation across diverse styles and text prompts demonstrates high-quality synthesis and fidelity, underscoring its efficacy in achieving consistent style across various inputs."
Google Research,"AI Alignment in the Design of Interactive AI: Specification Alignment,   Process Alignment, and Evaluation Support",23-Oct-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00710v1,,"AI alignment considers the overall problem of ensuring an AI produces desired outcomes, without undesirable side effects. While often considered from the perspectives of safety and human values, AI alignment can also be considered in the context of designing and evaluating interfaces for interactive AI systems. This paper maps concepts from AI alignment onto a basic, three step interaction cycle, yielding a corresponding set of alignment objectives: 1) specification alignment: ensuring the user can efficiently and reliably communicate objectives to the AI, 2) process alignment: providing the ability to verify and optionally control the AI's execution process, and 3) evaluation support: ensuring the user can verify and understand the AI's output. We also introduce the concepts of a surrogate process, defined as a simplified, separately derived, but controllable representation of the AI's actual process; and the notion of a Process Gulf, which highlights how differences between human and AI processes can lead to challenges in AI control. To illustrate the value of this framework, we describe commercial and research systems along each of the three alignment dimensions, and show how interfaces that provide interactive alignment mechanisms can lead to qualitatively different and improved user experiences."
Google Research,"It's an Alignment, Not a Trade-off: Revisiting Bias and Variance in Deep   Models",13-Oct-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09250v1,,"Classical wisdom in machine learning holds that the generalization error can be decomposed into bias and variance, and these two terms exhibit a \emph{trade-off}. However, in this paper, we show that for an ensemble of deep learning based classification models, bias and variance are \emph{aligned} at a sample level, where squared bias is approximately \emph{equal} to variance for correctly classified sample points. We present empirical evidence confirming this phenomenon in a variety of deep learning models and datasets. Moreover, we study this phenomenon from two theoretical perspectives: calibration and neural collapse. We first show theoretically that under the assumption that the models are well calibrated, we can observe the bias-variance alignment. Second, starting from the picture provided by the neural collapse theory, we show an approximate correlation between bias and variance."
"Center for Data Science, New York University, New York City, USA · Google Inc., U.S.A.",Improving Joint Speech-Text Representations Without Alignment,11-Aug-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06125v1,,"The last year has seen astonishing progress in text-prompted image generation premised on the idea of a cross-modal representation space in which the text and image domains are represented jointly. In ASR, this idea has found application as joint speech-text encoders that can scale to the capacities of very large parameter models by being trained on both unpaired speech and text. While these methods show promise, they have required special treatment of the sequence-length mismatch inherent in speech and text, either by up-sampling heuristics or an explicit alignment model. In this work, we offer evidence that joint speech-text encoders naturally achieve consistent representations across modalities by disregarding sequence length, and argue that consistency losses could forgive length differences and simply assume the best alignment. We show that such a loss improves downstream WER in both a large-parameter monolingual and multilingual system."
Princeton University · Google DeepMind,Robots That Ask For Help: Uncertainty Alignment for Large Language Model   Planners,04-Jul-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01928v2,,"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a wide range of promising capabilities -- from step-by-step planning to commonsense reasoning -- that may provide utility for robots, but remain prone to confidently hallucinated predictions. In this work, we present KnowNo, which is a framework for measuring and aligning the uncertainty of LLM-based planners such that they know when they don't know and ask for help when needed. KnowNo builds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on task completion while minimizing human help in complex multi-step planning settings. Experiments across a variety of simulated and real robot setups that involve tasks with different modes of ambiguity (e.g., from spatial to numeric uncertainties, from human preferences to Winograd schemas) show that KnowNo performs favorably over modern baselines (which may involve ensembles or extensive prompt tuning) in terms of improving efficiency and autonomy, while providing formal assurances. KnowNo can be used with LLMs out of the box without model-finetuning, and suggests a promising lightweight approach to modeling uncertainty that can complement and scale with the growing capabilities of foundation models.

Google DeepMind,Asynchronous Algorithmic Alignment with Cocycles,27-Jun-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15632v3,,"State-of-the-art neural algorithmic reasoners make use of message passing in graph neural networks (GNNs). But typical GNNs blur the distinction between the definition and invocation of the message function, forcing a node to send messages to its neighbours at every layer, synchronously. When applying GNNs to learn to execute dynamic programming algorithms, however, on most steps only a handful of the nodes would have meaningful updates to send. One, hence, runs the risk of inefficiencies by sending too much irrelevant data across the graph. But more importantly, many intermediate GNN steps have to learn the identity functions, which is a non-trivial learning problem. In this work, we explicitly separate the concepts of node state update and message function invocation. With this separation, we obtain a mathematical formulation that allows us to reason about asynchronous computation in both algorithms and neural networks. Our analysis yields several practical implementations of synchronous scalable GNN layers that are provably invariant under various forms of asynchrony."
Google DeepMind,Are aligned neural networks adversarially aligned?,26-Jun-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15447v2,,"Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be ""helpful and harmless."" These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study adversarial alignment, and ask to what extent these models remain aligned when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs.   However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models."
Google DeepMind,Training Socially Aligned Language Models on Simulated Social   Interactions,26-May-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16960v3,,"Social alignment in AI systems aims to ensure that these models behave according to established societal values. However, unlike humans, who derive consensus on value judgments through social interaction, current language models (LMs) are trained to rigidly replicate their training corpus in isolation, leading to subpar generalization in unfamiliar scenarios and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work presents a novel training paradigm that permits LMs to learn from simulated social interactions. In comparison to existing methodologies, our approach is considerably more scalable and efficient, demonstrating superior performance in alignment benchmarks and human evaluations. This paradigm shift in the training of LMs brings us a step closer to developing AI systems that can robustly and accurately reflect societal norms and values."
"Google · University of Maryland, College Park",ASIC: Aligning Sparse in-the-wild Image Collections,28-Mar-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16201v1,,"We present a method for joint alignment of sparse in-the-wild image collections of an object category. Most prior works assume either ground-truth keypoint annotations or a large dataset of images of a single object category. However, neither of the above assumptions hold true for the long-tail of the objects present in the world. We present a self-supervised technique that directly optimizes on a sparse collection of images of a particular object/object category to obtain consistent dense correspondences across the collection. We use pairwise nearest neighbors obtained from deep features of a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) model as noisy and sparse keypoint matches and make them dense and accurate matches by optimizing a neural network that jointly maps the image collection into a learned canonical grid. Experiments on CUB and SPair-71k benchmarks demonstrate that our method can produce globally consistent and higher quality correspondences across the image collection when compared to existing self-supervised methods. Code and other material will be made available at \url{https://kampta.github.io/asic}."
DeepMind,Three ways to improve feature alignment for open vocabulary detection,23-Mar-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13518v1,,"The core problem in zero-shot open vocabulary detection is how to align visual and text features, so that the detector performs well on unseen classes. Previous approaches train the feature pyramid and detection head from scratch, which breaks the vision-text feature alignment established during pretraining, and struggles to prevent the language model from forgetting unseen classes.   We propose three methods to alleviate these issues. Firstly, a simple scheme is used to augment the text embeddings which prevents overfitting to a small number of classes seen during training, while simultaneously saving memory and computation. Secondly, the feature pyramid network and the detection head are modified to include trainable gated shortcuts, which encourages vision-text feature alignment and guarantees it at the start of detection training. Finally, a self-training approach is used to leverage a larger corpus of image-text pairs thus improving detection performance on classes with no human annotated bounding boxes.   Our three methods are evaluated on the zero-shot version of the LVIS benchmark, each of them showing clear and significant benefits. Our final network achieves the new stateof-the-art on the mAP-all metric and demonstrates competitive performance for mAP-rare, as well as superior transfer to COCO and Objects365."
Google Research,Aligning Text-to-Image Models using Human Feedback,23-Feb-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12192v1,,"Deep generative models have shown impressive results in text-to-image synthesis. However, current text-to-image models often generate images that are inadequately aligned with text prompts. We propose a fine-tuning method for aligning such models using human feedback, comprising three stages. First, we collect human feedback assessing model output alignment from a set of diverse text prompts. We then use the human-labeled image-text dataset to train a reward function that predicts human feedback. Lastly, the text-to-image model is fine-tuned by maximizing reward-weighted likelihood to improve image-text alignment. Our method generates objects with specified colors, counts and backgrounds more accurately than the pre-trained model. We also analyze several design choices and find that careful investigations on such design choices are important in balancing the alignment-fidelity tradeoffs. Our results demonstrate the potential for learning from human feedback to significantly improve text-to-image models."
Google,Alignment Entropy Regularization,22-Dec-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12442v1,,"Existing training criteria in automatic speech recognition(ASR) permit the model to freely explore more than one time alignments between the feature and label sequences. In this paper, we use entropy to measure a model's uncertainty, i.e. how it chooses to distribute the probability mass over the set of allowed alignments. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of entropy regularization in encouraging the model to distribute the probability mass only on a smaller subset of allowed alignments. Experiments show that entropy regularization enables a much simpler decoding method without sacrificing word error rate, and provides better time alignment quality."
DeepMind,Improving alignment of dialogue agents via targeted human judgements,28-Sep-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14375v1,,"We present Sparrow, an information-seeking dialogue agent trained to be more helpful, correct, and harmless compared to prompted language model baselines. We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models. Second, our agent provides evidence from sources supporting factual claims when collecting preference judgements over model statements. For factual questions, evidence provided by Sparrow supports the sampled response 78% of the time. Sparrow is preferred more often than baselines while being more resilient to adversarial probing by humans, violating our rules only 8% of the time when probed. Finally, we conduct extensive analyses showing that though our model learns to follow our rules it can exhibit distributional biases."
"Google, Inc.",Streaming Align-Refine for Non-autoregressive Deliberation,15-Apr-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07556v1,,"We propose a streaming non-autoregressive (non-AR) decoding algorithm to deliberate the hypothesis alignment of a streaming RNN-T model. Our algorithm facilitates a simple greedy decoding procedure, and at the same time is capable of producing the decoding result at each frame with limited right context, thus enjoying both high efficiency and low latency. These advantages are achieved by converting the offline Align-Refine algorithm to be streaming-compatible, with a novel transformer decoder architecture that performs local self-attentions for both text and audio, and a time-aligned cross-attention at each layer. Furthermore, we perform discriminative training of our model with the minimum word error rate (MWER) criterion, which has not been done in the non-AR decoding literature. Experiments on voice search datasets and Librispeech show that with reasonable right context, our streaming model performs as well as the offline counterpart, and discriminative training leads to further WER gain when the first-pass model has small capacity."
DeepMind · UK,HCMD-zero: Learning Value Aligned Mechanisms from Data,21-Feb-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10122v2,,"Artificial learning agents are mediating a larger and larger number of interactions among humans, firms, and organizations, and the intersection between mechanism design and machine learning has been heavily investigated in recent years. However, mechanism design methods often make strong assumptions on how participants behave (e.g. rationality), on the kind of knowledge designers have access to a priori (e.g. access to strong baseline mechanisms), or on what the goal of the mechanism should be (e.g. total welfare). Here we introduce HCMD-zero, a general purpose method to construct mechanisms making none of these three assumptions. HCMD-zero learns to mediate interactions among participants and adjusts the mechanism parameters to make itself more likely to be preferred by participants. It does so by remaining engaged in an electoral contest with copies of itself, thereby accessing direct feedback from participants. We test our method on a stylized resource allocation game that highlights the tension between productivity, equality and the temptation to free ride. HCMD-zero produces a mechanism that is preferred by human participants over a strong baseline, it does so automatically, without requiring prior knowledge, and using human behavioral trajectories sparingly and effectively. Our analysis shows HCMD-zero consistently makes the mechanism policy more and more likely to be preferred by human participants over the course of training, and that it results in a mechanism with an interpretable and intuitive policy."
Google Brain,RNN Transducers for Nested Named Entity Recognition with constraints on   alignment for long sequences,08-Feb-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03543v1,,"Popular solutions to Named Entity Recognition (NER) include conditional random fields, sequence-to-sequence models, or utilizing the question-answering framework. However, they are not suitable for nested and overlapping spans with large ontologies and for predicting the position of the entities. To fill this gap, we introduce a new model for NER task -- an RNN transducer (RNN-T). These models are trained using paired input and output sequences without explicitly specifying the alignment between them, similar to other seq-to-seq models. RNN-T models learn the alignment using a loss function that sums over all alignments. In NER tasks, however, the alignment between words and target labels are available from the human annotations. We propose a fixed alignment RNN-T model that utilizes the given alignment, while preserving the benefits of RNN-Ts such as modeling output dependencies. As a more general case, we also propose a constrained alignment model where users can specify a relaxation of the given input alignment and the model will learn an alignment within the given constraints. In other words, we propose a family of seq-to-seq models which can leverage alignments between input and target sequences when available. Through empirical experiments on a challenging real-world medical NER task with multiple nested ontologies, we demonstrate that our fixed alignment model outperforms the standard RNN-T model, improving F1-score from 0.70 to 0.74."
Google DeepMind,Scalable AI Safety via Doubly-Efficient Debate,23-Nov-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14125v1,,"The emergence of pre-trained AI systems with powerful capabilities across a diverse and ever-increasing set of complex domains has raised a critical challenge for AI safety as tasks can become too complicated for humans to judge directly. Irving et al. [2018] proposed a debate method in this direction with the goal of pitting the power of such AI models against each other until the problem of identifying (mis)-alignment is broken down into a manageable subtask. While the promise of this approach is clear, the original framework was based on the assumption that the honest strategy is able to simulate deterministic AI systems for an exponential number of steps, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we show how to address these challenges by designing a new set of debate protocols where the honest strategy can always succeed using a simulation of a polynomial number of steps, whilst being able to verify the alignment of stochastic AI systems, even when the dishonest strategy is allowed to use exponentially many simulation steps."
Google Research,Improving Few-shot Generalization of Safety Classifiers via Data   Augmented Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,25-Oct-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16959v1,,"As large language models (LLMs) are widely adopted, new safety issues and policies emerge, to which existing safety classifiers do not generalize well. If we have only observed a few examples of violations of a new safety rule, how can we build a classifier to detect violations? In this paper, we study the novel setting of domain-generalized few-shot learning for LLM-based text safety classifiers. Unlike prior few-shot work, these new safety issues can be hard to uncover and we do not get to choose the few examples. We demonstrate that existing few-shot techniques do not perform well in this setting, and rather we propose to do parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) combined with augmenting training data based on similar examples in prior existing rules. We empirically show that our approach of similarity-based data-augmentation + prompt-tuning (DAPT) consistently outperforms baselines that either do not rely on data augmentation or on PEFT by 7-17% F1 score in the Social Chemistry moral judgement and 9-13% AUC in the Toxicity detection tasks, even when the new rule is loosely correlated with existing ones."
"Google DeepMind · London N1C 4DN, United Kingdom",Sociotechnical Safety Evaluation of Generative AI Systems,18-Oct-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11986v2,,"Generative AI systems produce a range of risks. To ensure the safety of generative AI systems, these risks must be evaluated. In this paper, we make two main contributions toward establishing such evaluations. First, we propose a three-layered framework that takes a structured, sociotechnical approach to evaluating these risks. This framework encompasses capability evaluations, which are the main current approach to safety evaluation. It then reaches further by building on system safety principles, particularly the insight that context determines whether a given capability may cause harm. To account for relevant context, our framework adds human interaction and systemic impacts as additional layers of evaluation. Second, we survey the current state of safety evaluation of generative AI systems and create a repository of existing evaluations. Three salient evaluation gaps emerge from this analysis. We propose ways forward to closing these gaps, outlining practical steps as well as roles and responsibilities for different actors. Sociotechnical safety evaluation is a tractable approach to the robust and comprehensive safety evaluation of generative AI systems."
Google Research,Safety and Fairness for Content Moderation in Generative Models,09-Jun-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06135v1,,"With significant advances in generative AI, new technologies are rapidly being deployed with generative components. Generative models are typically trained on large datasets, resulting in model behaviors that can mimic the worst of the content in the training data. Responsible deployment of generative technologies requires content moderation strategies, such as safety input and output filters. Here, we provide a theoretical framework for conceptualizing responsible content moderation of text-to-image generative technologies, including a demonstration of how to empirically measure the constructs we enumerate. We define and distinguish the concepts of safety, fairness, and metric equity, and enumerate example harms that can come in each domain. We then provide a demonstration of how the defined harms can be quantified. We conclude with a summary of how the style of harms quantification we demonstrate enables data-driven content moderation decisions."
Google,Adversarial Nibbler: A Data-Centric Challenge for Improving the Safety   of Text-to-Image Models,22-May-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14384v1,,"The generative AI revolution in recent years has been spurred by an expansion in compute power and data quantity, which together enable extensive pre-training of powerful text-to-image (T2I) models. With their greater capabilities to generate realistic and creative content, these T2I models like DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagen or Stable Diffusion are reaching ever wider audiences. Any unsafe behaviors inherited from pretraining on uncurated internet-scraped datasets thus have the potential to cause wide-reaching harm, for example, through generated images which are violent, sexually explicit, or contain biased and derogatory stereotypes. Despite this risk of harm, we lack systematic and structured evaluation datasets to scrutinize model behavior, especially adversarial attacks that bypass existing safety filters. A typical bottleneck in safety evaluation is achieving a wide coverage of different types of challenging examples in the evaluation set, i.e., identifying 'unknown unknowns' or long-tail problems. To address this need, we introduce the Adversarial Nibbler challenge. The goal of this challenge is to crowdsource a diverse set of failure modes and reward challenge participants for successfully finding safety vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art T2I models. Ultimately, we aim to provide greater awareness of these issues and assist developers in improving the future safety and reliability of generative AI models. Adversarial Nibbler is a data-centric challenge, part of the DataPerf challenge suite, organized and supported by Kaggle and MLCommons."
"Google Research · McGill University, Canada",From plane crashes to algorithmic harm: applicability of safety   engineering frameworks for responsible ML,06-Oct-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03535v1,,"Inappropriate design and deployment of machine learning (ML) systems leads to negative downstream social and ethical impact -- described here as social and ethical risks -- for users, society and the environment. Despite the growing need to regulate ML systems, current processes for assessing and mitigating risks are disjointed and inconsistent. We interviewed 30 industry practitioners on their current social and ethical risk management practices, and collected their first reactions on adapting safety engineering frameworks into their practice -- namely, System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Our findings suggest STPA/FMEA can provide appropriate structure toward social and ethical risk assessment and mitigation processes. However, we also find nontrivial challenges in integrating such frameworks in the fast-paced culture of the ML industry. We call on the ML research community to strengthen existing frameworks and assess their efficacy, ensuring that ML systems are safer for all people."
University of Oxford · DeepMind,Path-Specific Objectives for Safer Agent Incentives,21-Apr-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10018v1,,"We present a general framework for training safe agents whose naive incentives are unsafe. As an example, manipulative or deceptive behaviour can improve rewards but should be avoided. Most approaches fail here: agents maximize expected return by any means necessary. We formally describe settings with 'delicate' parts of the state which should not be used as a means to an end. We then train agents to maximize the causal effect of actions on the expected return which is not mediated by the delicate parts of state, using Causal Influence Diagram analysis. The resulting agents have no incentive to control the delicate state. We further show how our framework unifies and generalizes existing proposals."
"Google Research · Mountain View, CA, USA",Smartphone-based Hard-braking Event Detection at Scale for Road Safety   Services,04-Feb-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01934v1,,"Road crashes are the sixth leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. One major challenge in traffic safety research is the sparsity of crashes, which makes it difficult to achieve a fine-grain understanding of crash causations and predict future crash risk in a timely manner. Hard-braking events have been widely used as a safety surrogate due to their relatively high prevalence and ease of detection with embedded vehicle sensors. As an alternative to using sensors fixed in vehicles, this paper presents a scalable approach for detecting hard-braking events using the kinematics data collected from smartphone sensors. We train a Transformer-based machine learning model for hard-braking event detection using concurrent sensor readings from smartphones and vehicle sensors from drivers who connect their phone to the vehicle while navigating in Google Maps. The detection model shows superior performance with a $0.83$ Area under the Precision-Recall Curve (PR-AUC), which is $3.8\times$better than a GPS speed-based heuristic model, and $166.6\times$better than an accelerometer-based heuristic model. The detected hard-braking events are strongly correlated with crashes from publicly available datasets, supporting their use as a safety surrogate. In addition, we conduct model fairness and selection bias evaluation to ensure that the safety benefits are equally shared. The developed methodology can benefit many safety applications such as identifying safety hot spots at road network level, evaluating the safety of new user interfaces, as well as using routing to improve traffic safety."
DeepMind,Safe Deep RL in 3D Environments using Human Feedback,20-Jan-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08102v2,,"Agents should avoid unsafe behaviour during both training and deployment. This typically requires a simulator and a procedural specification of unsafe behaviour. Unfortunately, a simulator is not always available, and procedurally specifying constraints can be difficult or impossible for many real-world tasks. A recently introduced technique, ReQueST, aims to solve this problem by learning a neural simulator of the environment from safe human trajectories, then using the learned simulator to efficiently learn a reward model from human feedback. However, it is yet unknown whether this approach is feasible in complex 3D environments with feedback obtained from real humans - whether sufficient pixel-based neural simulator quality can be achieved, and whether the human data requirements are viable in terms of both quantity and quality. In this paper we answer this question in the affirmative, using ReQueST to train an agent to perform a 3D first-person object collection task using data entirely from human contractors. We show that the resulting agent exhibits an order of magnitude reduction in unsafe behaviour compared to standard reinforcement learning."
Google LLC · USA,On Robustness to Missing Video for Audiovisual Speech Recognition,13-Dec-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10088v2,,"It has been shown that learning audiovisual features can lead to improved speech recognition performance over audio-only features, especially for noisy speech. However, in many common applications, the visual features are partially or entirely missing, e.g.~the speaker might move off screen. Multi-modal models need to be robust: missing video frames should not degrade the performance of an audiovisual model to be worse than that of a single-modality audio-only model. While there have been many attempts at building robust models, there is little consensus on how robustness should be evaluated. To address this, we introduce a framework that allows claims about robustness to be evaluated in a precise and testable way. We also conduct a systematic empirical study of the robustness of common audiovisual speech recognition architectures on a range of acoustic noise conditions and test suites. Finally, we show that an architecture-agnostic solution based on cascades can consistently achieve robustness to missing video, even in settings where existing techniques for robustness like dropout fall short."
"Google · 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043",SARA-RT: Scaling up Robotics Transformers with Self-Adaptive Robust   Attention,04-Dec-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01990v1,,"We present Self-Adaptive Robust Attention for Robotics Transformers (SARA-RT): a new paradigm for addressing the emerging challenge of scaling up Robotics Transformers (RT) for on-robot deployment. SARA-RT relies on the new method of fine-tuning proposed by us, called up-training. It converts pre-trained or already fine-tuned Transformer-based robotic policies of quadratic time complexity (including massive billion-parameter vision-language-action models or VLAs), into their efficient linear-attention counterparts maintaining high quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SARA-RT by speeding up: (a) the class of recently introduced RT-2 models, the first VLA robotic policies pre-trained on internet-scale data, as well as (b) Point Cloud Transformer (PCT) robotic policies operating on large point clouds. We complement our results with the rigorous mathematical analysis providing deeper insight into the phenomenon of SARA."
Google Research,A Combinatorial Approach to Robust PCA,28-Nov-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16416v1,,"We study the problem of recovering Gaussian data under adversarial corruptions when the noises are low-rank and the corruptions are on the coordinate level. Concretely, we assume that the Gaussian noises lie in an unknown $k$-dimensional subspace $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, and $s$ randomly chosen coordinates of each data point fall into the control of an adversary. This setting models the scenario of learning from high-dimensional yet structured data that are transmitted through a highly-noisy channel, so that the data points are unlikely to be entirely clean.   Our main result is an efficient algorithm that, when $ks^2 = O(d)$, recovers every single data point up to a nearly-optimal $\ell_1$ error of $\tilde O(ks/d)$ in expectation. At the core of our proof is a new analysis of the well-known Basis Pursuit (BP) method for recovering a sparse signal, which is known to succeed under additional assumptions (e.g., incoherence or the restricted isometry property) on the underlying subspace $U$. In contrast, we present a novel approach via studying a natural combinatorial problem and show that, over the randomness in the support of the sparse signal, a high-probability error bound is possible even if the subspace $U$ is arbitrary."
Google DeepMind,"Frontier Language Models are not Robust to Adversarial Arithmetic, or   ""What do I need to say so you agree 2+2=5?",08-Nov-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07587v2,,"We introduce and study the problem of adversarial arithmetic, which provides a simple yet challenging testbed for language model alignment. This problem is comprised of arithmetic questions posed in natural language, with an arbitrary adversarial string inserted before the question is complete. Even in the simple setting of 1-digit addition problems, it is easy to find adversarial prompts that make all tested models (including PaLM2, GPT4, Claude2) misbehave, and even to steer models to a particular wrong answer. We additionally provide a simple algorithm for finding successful attacks by querying those same models, which we name ""prompt inversion rejection sampling"" (PIRS). We finally show that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement learning and via agentic constitutional loops. However, we were not able to make a language model fully robust against adversarial arithmetic attacks."
Google Research,"Break it, Imitate it, Fix it: Robustness by Generating Human-Like   Attacks",25-Oct-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16955v2,,"Real-world natural language processing systems need to be robust to human adversaries. Collecting examples of human adversaries for training is an effective but expensive solution. On the other hand, training on synthetic attacks with small perturbations - such as word-substitution - does not actually improve robustness to human adversaries. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training framework that uses limited human adversarial examples to generate more useful adversarial examples at scale. We demonstrate the advantages of this system on the ANLI and hate speech detection benchmark datasets - both collected via an iterative, adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. Compared to training only on observed human attacks, also training on our synthetic adversarial examples improves model robustness to future rounds. In ANLI, we see accuracy gains on the current set of attacks (44.1%$\,\to\,$50.1%) and on two future unseen rounds of human generated attacks (32.5%$\,\to\,$43.4%, and 29.4%$\,\to\,$40.2%). In hate speech detection, we see AUC gains on current attacks (0.76 $\to$ 0.84) and a future round (0.77 $\to$ 0.79). Attacks from methods that do not learn the distribution of existing human adversaries, meanwhile, degrade robustness."
The University of Texas at Austin · Google,Profit: Benchmarking Personalization and Robustness Trade-off in   Federated Prompt Tuning,06-Oct-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04627v1,,"In many applications of federated learning (FL), clients desire models that are personalized using their local data, yet are also robust in the sense that they retain general global knowledge. However, the presence of data heterogeneity across clients induces a fundamental trade-off between personalization (i.e., adaptation to a local distribution) and robustness (i.e., not forgetting previously learned general knowledge). It is critical to understand how to navigate this personalization vs robustness trade-off when designing federated systems, which are increasingly moving towards a paradigm of fine-tuning large foundation models. Due to limited computational and communication capabilities in most federated settings, this foundation model fine-tuning must be done using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches. While some recent work has studied federated approaches to PEFT, the personalization vs robustness trade-off of federated PEFT has been largely unexplored. In this work, we take a step towards bridging this gap by benchmarking fundamental FL algorithms -- FedAvg and FedSGD plus personalization (via client local fine-tuning) -- applied to one of the most ubiquitous PEFT approaches to large language models (LLMs) -- prompt tuning -- in a multitude of hyperparameter settings under varying levels of data heterogeneity. Our results show that federated-trained prompts can be surprisingly robust when using a small learning rate with many local epochs for personalization, especially when using an adaptive optimizer as the client optimizer during federated training. We also demonstrate that simple approaches such as adding regularization and interpolating two prompts are effective in improving the personalization vs robustness trade-off in computation-limited settings with few local updates allowed for personalization."

We propose Kepler, an end-to-end learning-based approach to PQO that demonstrates significant speedups in query latency over a traditional query optimizer. Central to our method is Row Count Evolution (RCE), a novel plan generation algorithm based on perturbations in the sub-plan cardinality space. While previous approaches require accurate cost models, we bypass this requirement by evaluating candidate plans via actual execution data and training an ML model to predict the fastest plan given parameter binding values. Our models leverage recent advances in neural network uncertainty in order to robustly predict faster plans while avoiding regressions in query performance. Experimentally, we show that Kepler achieves significant improvements in query runtime on multiple datasets on PostgreSQL."

Quantization is an effective technique at decreasing the model size, memory access, and compute load of large models. Despite recent advances in quantization aware training (QAT) technique, most papers present evaluations that are focused on computer vision tasks, which have different training dynamics compared to sequence tasks. In this paper, we first benchmark the impact of popular techniques such as straight through estimator, pseudo-quantization noise, learnable scale parameter, clipping, etc. on 4-bit seq2seq models across a suite of speech recognition datasets ranging from 1,000 hours to 1 million hours, as well as one machine translation dataset to illustrate its applicability outside of speech.   Through the experiments, we report that noise based QAT suffers when there is insufficient regularization signal flowing back to the quantization scale. We propose low complexity changes to the QAT process to improve model accuracy (outperforming popular learnable scale and clipping methods). With the improved accuracy, it opens up the possibility to exploit some of the other benefits of noise based QAT: 1) training a single model that performs well in mixed precision mode and 2) improved generalization on long form speech recognition."
Google Research · USA,Improving Classifier Robustness through Active Generation of Pairwise   Counterfactuals,22-May-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13535v1,,"Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) is a commonly used technique for improving robustness in natural language classifiers. However, one fundamental challenge is how to discover meaningful counterfactuals and efficiently label them, with minimal human labeling cost. Most existing methods either completely rely on human-annotated labels, an expensive process which limits the scale of counterfactual data, or implicitly assume label invariance, which may mislead the model with incorrect labels. In this paper, we present a novel framework that utilizes counterfactual generative models to generate a large number of diverse counterfactuals by actively sampling from regions of uncertainty, and then automatically label them with a learned pairwise classifier. Our key insight is that we can more correctly label the generated counterfactuals by training a pairwise classifier that interpolates the relationship between the original example and the counterfactual. We demonstrate that with a small amount of human-annotated counterfactual data (10%), we can generate a counterfactual augmentation dataset with learned labels, that provides an 18-20% improvement in robustness and a 14-21% reduction in errors on 6 out-of-domain datasets, comparable to that of a fully human-annotated counterfactual dataset for both sentiment classification and question paraphrase tasks."

The resulting algorithm, POIR, can be trained offline, and leverages online interactions to efficiently fine-tune its planner to improve performance over time.

Google Research,What Are Effective Labels for Augmented Data? Improving Calibration and   Robustness with AutoLabel,22-Feb-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11188v1,,"A wide breadth of research has devised data augmentation approaches that can improve both accuracy and generalization performance for neural networks. However, augmented data can end up being far from the clean training data and what is the appropriate label is less clear. Despite this, most existing work simply uses one-hot labels for augmented data. In this paper, we show re-using one-hot labels for highly distorted data might run the risk of adding noise and degrading accuracy and calibration. To mitigate this, we propose a generic method AutoLabel to automatically learn the confidence in the labels for augmented data, based on the transformation distance between the clean distribution and augmented distribution. AutoLabel is built on label smoothing and is guided by the calibration-performance over a hold-out validation set. We successfully apply AutoLabel to three different data augmentation techniques: the state-of-the-art RandAug, AugMix, and adversarial training. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that AutoLabel significantly improves existing data augmentation techniques over models' calibration and accuracy, especially under distributional shift."
Google Research,Pushing the Accuracy-Group Robustness Frontier with Introspective   Self-play,11-Feb-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05807v1,,"Standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) training can produce deep neural network (DNN) models that are accurate on average but under-perform in under-represented population subgroups, especially when there are imbalanced group distributions in the long-tailed training data. Therefore, approaches that improve the accuracy-group robustness trade-off frontier of a DNN model (i.e. improving worst-group accuracy without sacrificing average accuracy, or vice versa) is of crucial importance. Uncertainty-based active learning (AL) can potentially improve the frontier by preferentially sampling underrepresented subgroups to create a more balanced training dataset. However, the quality of uncertainty estimates from modern DNNs tend to degrade in the presence of spurious correlations and dataset bias, compromising the effectiveness of AL for sampling tail groups. In this work, we propose Introspective Self-play (ISP), a simple approach to improve the uncertainty estimation of a deep neural network under dataset bias, by adding an auxiliary introspection task requiring a model to predict the bias for each data point in addition to the label. We show that ISP provably improves the bias-awareness of the model representation and the resulting uncertainty estimates. On two real-world tabular and language tasks, ISP serves as a simple ""plug-in"" for AL model training, consistently improving both the tail-group sampling rate and the final accuracy-fairness trade-off frontier of popular AL methods."

When scenes include distractors, which are not persistent during image capture (moving objects, lighting variations, shadows), artifacts appear as view-dependent effects or 'floaters'. To cope with distractors, we advocate a form of robust estimation for NeRF training, modeling distractors in training data as outliers of an optimization problem. Our method successfully removes outliers from a scene and improves upon our baselines, on synthetic and real-world scenes. Our technique is simple to incorporate in modern NeRF frameworks, with few hyper-parameters. It does not assume a priori knowledge of the types of distractors, and is instead focused on the optimization problem rather than pre-processing or modeling transient objects.

Unfortunately, resourceful actors try to bypass automated filters in a bid to post content that violate platform policies and codes of conduct. To reach this goal, these malicious actors may obfuscate policy violating images (e.g. overlay harmful images by carefully selected benign images or visual patterns) to prevent machine learning models from reaching the correct decision. In this paper, we invite researchers to tackle this specific issue and present a new image benchmark. This benchmark, based on ImageNet, simulates the type of obfuscations created by malicious actors. It goes beyond ImageNet-$\textrm{C}$ and ImageNet-$\bar{\textrm{C}}$ by proposing general, drastic, adversarial modifications that preserve the original content intent. It aims to tackle a more common adversarial threat than the one considered by $\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries. We evaluate 33 pretrained models on the benchmark and train models with different augmentations, architectures and training methods on subsets of the obfuscations to measure generalization. We hope this benchmark will encourage researchers to test their models and methods and try to find new approaches that are more robust to these obfuscations."

The auxiliary network is trained using a meta-objective in a bilevel optimization framework. A key contribution of our proposal is the meta-objective of minimizing the dropout variance, an approximation of Bayesian Predictive uncertainty. We show in controlled experiments that we effectively capture the diverse specific notions of uncertainty through this meta-objective, while previous approaches only capture certain aspects. These results translate to significant gains in real-world settings-selective classification, label noise, domain adaptation, calibration-and across datasets-Imagenet, Cifar100, diabetic retinopathy, Camelyon, WILDs, Imagenet-C,-A,-R, Clothing1M, etc. For Diabetic Retinopathy, we see upto 3.4%/3.3% accuracy and AUC gains over SOTA in selective classification.

Google Research,On the Adversarial Robustness of Mixture of Experts,19-Oct-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10253v1,,"Adversarial robustness is a key desirable property of neural networks. It has been empirically shown to be affected by their sizes, with larger networks being typically more robust. Recently, Bubeck and Sellke proved a lower bound on the Lipschitz constant of functions that fit the training data in terms of their number of parameters. This raises an interesting open question, do -- and can -- functions with more parameters, but not necessarily more computational cost, have better robustness? We study this question for sparse Mixture of Expert models (MoEs), that make it possible to scale up the model size for a roughly constant computational cost. We theoretically show that under certain conditions on the routing and the structure of the data, MoEs can have significantly smaller Lipschitz constants than their dense counterparts. The robustness of MoEs can suffer when the highest weighted experts for an input implement sufficiently different functions. We next empirically evaluate the robustness of MoEs on ImageNet using adversarial attacks and show they are indeed more robust than dense models with the same computational cost. We make key observations showing the robustness of MoEs to the choice of experts, highlighting the redundancy of experts in models trained in practice."

In large-scale applications, however, the teacher tends to provide a large number of incorrect soft-labels that impairs student performance. The sheer size of the teacher additionally constrains the number of soft-labels that can be queried due to prohibitive computational and/or financial costs. The difficulty in achieving simultaneous \emph{efficiency} (i.e., minimizing soft-label queries) and \emph{robustness} (i.e., avoiding student inaccuracies due to incorrect labels) hurts the widespread application of knowledge distillation to many modern tasks. In this paper, we present a parameter-free approach with provable guarantees to query the soft-labels of points that are simultaneously informative and correctly labeled by the teacher. At the core of our work lies a game-theoretic formulation that explicitly considers the inherent trade-off between the informativeness and correctness of input instances. We establish bounds on the expected performance of our approach that hold even in worst-case distillation instances. We present empirical evaluations on popular benchmarks that demonstrate the improved distillation performance enabled by our work relative to that of state-of-the-art active learning and active distillation methods."

In this paper, we use tools from dynamical systems to investigate the inductive biases and stability properties of optimization algorithms, and apply the resulting insights to designing inductive biases for blackbox optimizers. Our investigation begins with a noisy quadratic model, where we characterize conditions in which optimization is stable, in terms of eigenvalues of the training dynamics. We then introduce simple modifications to a learned optimizer's architecture and meta-training procedure which lead to improved stability, and improve the optimizer's inductive bias. We apply the resulting learned optimizer to a variety of neural network training tasks, where it outperforms the current state of the art learned optimizer -- at matched optimizer computational overhead -- with regard to optimization performance and meta-training speed, and is capable of generalization to tasks far different from those it was meta-trained on."

In this work, we construct a new benchmark for evaluating and improving model robustness by applying perturbations to existing data. Specifically, we conduct an extensive labeling effort to identify causal agents, or agents whose presence influences human drivers' behavior in any format, in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), and we use these labels to perturb the data by deleting non-causal agents from the scene. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art deep-learning model architectures on our proposed benchmark and find that all models exhibit large shifts under even non-causal perturbation: we observe a 25-38% relative change in minADE as compared to the original. We also investigate techniques to improve model robustness, including increasing the training dataset size and using targeted data augmentations that randomly drop non-causal agents throughout training. Finally, we release the causal agent labels (at https://github.com/google-research/causal-agents) as an additional attribute to WOMD and the robustness benchmarks to aid the community in building more reliable and safe deep-learning models for motion forecasting."

When the inputs are {\em not adaptive} (do not depend on prior outputs), classic estimators applied to a sketch of size $O(\ell/\epsilon)$ are accurate for a number of queries that is exponential in $\ell$. When inputs are adaptive, however, an adversarial input can be constructed after $O(\ell)$ queries with the classic estimator and the best known robust estimator only supports $\tilde{O}(\ell^2)$ queries. In this work we show that this quadratic dependence is in a sense inherent: We design an attack that after $O(\ell^2)$ queries produces an adversarial input vector whose sketch is highly biased. Our attack uses ""natural"" non-adaptive inputs (only the final adversarial input is chosen adaptively) and universally applies with any correct estimator, including one that is unknown to the attacker. In that, we expose inherent vulnerability of this fundamental method."

An epinet is a small neural network added to traditional neural networks, which, together, can produce predictive distributions. In particular, using an epinet can greatly improve the quality of joint predictions across multiple inputs, a measure of how well a neural network knows what it does not know. In this paper, we examine whether epinets can offer similar advantages under distributional shifts. We find that, across ImageNet-A/O/C, epinets generally improve robustness metrics. Moreover, these improvements are more significant than those afforded by even very large ensembles at orders of magnitude lower computational costs. However, these improvements are relatively small compared to the outstanding issues in distributionally-robust deep learning. Epinets may be a useful tool in the toolbox, but they are far from the complete solution."

Specifically, we introduce robust optimization objectives in different combinations for the teacher and student, and further allow for training with any tradeoff between the overall accuracy and the robust worst-class objective. We show empirically that our robust distillation techniques not only achieve better worst-class performance, but also lead to Pareto improvement in the tradeoff between overall performance and worst-class performance compared to other baseline methods.

However, such systems tend to demonstrate sub-optimal ""out-of-distribution"" performance when evaluated in clinical settings different from the training environment. A common mitigation strategy is to develop separate systems for each clinical setting using site-specific data [1]. However, this quickly becomes impractical as medical data is time-consuming to acquire and expensive to annotate [2]. Thus, the problem of ""data-efficient generalization"" presents an ongoing difficulty for Medical AI development. Although progress in representation learning shows promise, their benefits have not been rigorously studied, specifically for out-of-distribution settings. To meet these challenges, we present REMEDIS, a unified representation learning strategy to improve robustness and data-efficiency of medical imaging AI. REMEDIS uses a generic combination of large-scale supervised transfer learning with self-supervised learning and requires little task-specific customization. We study a diverse range of medical imaging tasks and simulate three realistic application scenarios using retrospective data. REMEDIS exhibits significantly improved in-distribution performance with up to 11.5% relative improvement in diagnostic accuracy over a strong supervised baseline. More importantly, our strategy leads to strong data-efficient generalization of medical imaging AI, matching strong supervised baselines using between 1% to 33% of retraining data across tasks. These results suggest that REMEDIS can significantly accelerate the life-cycle of medical imaging AI development thereby presenting an important step forward for medical imaging AI to deliver broad impact."

We study the robustness of the sketch in adaptive settings where input vectors may depend on the output from prior inputs. Adaptive settings arise in processes with feedback or with adversarial attacks. We show that the classic estimator is not robust, and can be attacked with a number of queries of the order of the sketch size.

The answer should depend upon whether these datasets are generated by the same or different distributions over their mutual feature sets, and how similar the test distribution will be to either of those distributions. In many applications, the two datasets will likely follow different distributions, but both may be close to the test distribution. We introduce the problem of building a predictor which minimizes the maximum loss over all probability distributions over the original features, auxiliary features, and binary labels, whose Wasserstein distance is $r_1$ away from the empirical distribution over the labeled dataset and $r_2$ away from that of the unlabeled dataset. This can be thought of as a generalization of distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which allows for two data sources, one of which is unlabeled and may contain auxiliary features."

The learner has access to a family of weight functions such that the test distribution is a reweighting of the training distribution under one of these functions, a setting typically studied under the name of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). We consider the problem of deriving regret bounds in the classical learning theory setting, and require that the resulting regret bounds hold uniformly for all potential test distributions. We show that the DRO formulation does not guarantee uniformly small regret under distribution shift. We instead propose an alternative method called Minimax Regret Optimization (MRO), and show that under suitable conditions this method achieves uniformly low regret across all test distributions. We also adapt our technique to have stronger guarantees when the test distributions are heterogeneous in their similarity to the training data. Given the widespead optimization of worst case risks in current approaches to robust machine learning, we believe that MRO can be a strong alternative to address distribution shift scenarios."

We first study convergence of gradient descent based adversarial training with differential privacy, taking a simple binary classification task on linearly separable data as an illustrative example. We compare the gap between adversarial and nominal risk in both private and non-private settings, showing that the data dimensionality dependent term introduced by private optimization compounds the difficulties of learning a robust model. After this, we discuss what parts of adversarial training and differential privacy hurt optimization, identifying that the size of adversarial perturbation and clipping norm in differential privacy both increase the curvature of the loss landscape, implying poorer generalization performance."
DeepMind,Power-seeking can be probable and predictive for trained agents,13-Apr-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06528v1,,"Power-seeking behavior is a key source of risk from advanced AI, but our theoretical understanding of this phenomenon is relatively limited. Building on existing theoretical results demonstrating power-seeking incentives for most reward functions, we investigate how the training process affects power-seeking incentives and show that they are still likely to hold for trained agents under some simplifying assumptions. We formally define the training-compatible goal set (the set of goals consistent with the training rewards) and assume that the trained agent learns a goal from this set. In a setting where the trained agent faces a choice to shut down or avoid shutdown in a new situation, we prove that the agent is likely to avoid shutdown. Thus, we show that power-seeking incentives can be probable (likely to arise for trained agents) and predictive (allowing us to predict undesirable behavior in new situations)."
Google DeepMind,Population-based Evaluation in Repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors as a   Benchmark for Multiagent Reinforcement Learning,02-Mar-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03196v2,,"Progress in fields of machine learning and adversarial planning has benefited significantly from benchmark domains, from checkers and the classic UCI data sets to Go and Diplomacy. In sequential decision-making, agent evaluation has largely been restricted to few interactions against experts, with the aim to reach some desired level of performance (e.g. beating a human professional player). We propose a benchmark for multiagent learning based on repeated play of the simple game Rock, Paper, Scissors along with a population of forty-three tournament entries, some of which are intentionally sub-optimal. We describe metrics to measure the quality of agents based both on average returns and exploitability. We then show that several RL, online learning, and language model approaches can learn good counter-strategies and generalize well, but ultimately lose to the top-performing bots, creating an opportunity for research in multiagent learning."
Google Research,A Multiagent Framework for the Asynchronous and Collaborative Extension   of Multitask ML Systems,29-Sep-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14745v2,,"The traditional ML development methodology does not enable a large number of contributors, each with distinct objectives, to work collectively on the creation and extension of a shared intelligent system. Enabling such a collaborative methodology can accelerate the rate of innovation, increase ML technologies accessibility and enable the emergence of novel capabilities. We believe that this novel methodology for ML development can be demonstrated through a modularized representation of ML models and the definition of novel abstractions allowing to implement and execute diverse methods for the asynchronous use and extension of modular intelligent systems. We present a multiagent framework for the collaborative and asynchronous extension of dynamic large-scale multitask systems."
DeepMind,Mastering the Game of Stratego with Model-Free Multiagent Reinforcement   Learning,30-Jun-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15378v1,,"We introduce DeepNash, an autonomous agent capable of learning to play the imperfect information game Stratego from scratch, up to a human expert level. Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has not yet mastered. This popular game has an enormous game tree on the order of $10^{535}$ nodes, i.e., $10^{175}$ times larger than that of Go. It has the additional complexity of requiring decision-making under imperfect information, similar to Texas hold'em poker, which has a significantly smaller game tree (on the order of $10^{164}$ nodes). Decisions in Stratego are made over a large number of discrete actions with no obvious link between action and outcome. Episodes are long, with often hundreds of moves before a player wins, and situations in Stratego can not easily be broken down into manageably-sized sub-problems as in poker. For these reasons, Stratego has been a grand challenge for the field of AI for decades, and existing AI methods barely reach an amateur level of play. DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego via self-play. The Regularised Nash Dynamics (R-NaD) algorithm, a key component of DeepNash, converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium, instead of 'cycling' around it, by directly modifying the underlying multi-agent learning dynamics. DeepNash beats existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a yearly (2022) and all-time top-3 rank on the Gravon games platform, competing with human expert players."
Google Research,Beyond Rewards: a Hierarchical Perspective on Offline Multiagent   Behavioral Analysis,17-Jun-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09046v3,,"Each year, expert-level performance is attained in increasingly-complex multiagent domains, where notable examples include Go, Poker, and StarCraft II. This rapid progression is accompanied by a commensurate need to better understand how such agents attain this performance, to enable their safe deployment, identify limitations, and reveal potential means of improving them. In this paper we take a step back from performance-focused multiagent learning, and instead turn our attention towards agent behavior analysis. We introduce a model-agnostic method for discovery of behavior clusters in multiagent domains, using variational inference to learn a hierarchy of behaviors at the joint and local agent levels. Our framework makes no assumption about agents' underlying learning algorithms, does not require access to their latent states or policies, and is trained using only offline observational data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method for enabling the coupled understanding of behaviors at the joint and local agent level, detection of behavior changepoints throughout training, discovery of core behavioral concepts, demonstrate the approach's scalability to a high-dimensional multiagent MuJoCo control domain, and also illustrate that the approach can disentangle previously-trained policies in OpenAI's hide-and-seek domain."
Google Research,Honest Students from Untrusted Teachers: Learning an Interpretable   Question-Answering Pipeline from a Pretrained Language Model,05-Oct-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02498v3,,"Explainable question answering systems should produce not only accurate answers but also rationales that justify their reasoning and allow humans to check their work. But what sorts of rationales are useful and how can we train systems to produce them? We propose a new style of rationale for open-book question answering, called \emph{markup-and-mask}, which combines aspects of extractive and free-text explanations. In the markup phase, the passage is augmented with free-text markup that enables each sentence to stand on its own outside the discourse context. In the masking phase, a sub-span of the marked-up passage is selected. To train a system to produce markup-and-mask rationales without annotations, we leverage in-context learning. Specifically, we generate silver annotated data by sending a series of prompts to a frozen pretrained language model, which acts as a teacher. We then fine-tune a smaller student model by training on the subset of rationales that led to correct answers. The student is ""honest"" in the sense that it is a pipeline: the rationale acts as a bottleneck between the passage and the answer, while the ""untrusted"" teacher operates under no such constraints. Thus, we offer a new way to build trustworthy pipeline systems from a combination of end-task annotations and frozen pretrained language models."
Google DeepMind,Nash Learning from Human Feedback,01-Dec-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00886v4,,"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the main paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Typically, RLHF involves the initial step of learning a reward model from human feedback, often expressed as preferences between pairs of text generations produced by a pre-trained LLM. Subsequently, the LLM's policy is fine-tuned by optimizing it to maximize the reward model through a reinforcement learning algorithm. However, an inherent limitation of current reward models is their inability to fully represent the richness of human preferences and their dependency on the sampling distribution.   In this study, we introduce an alternative pipeline for the fine-tuning of LLMs using pairwise human feedback. Our approach entails the initial learning of a preference model, which is conditioned on two inputs given a prompt, followed by the pursuit of a policy that consistently generates responses preferred over those generated by any competing policy, thus defining the Nash equilibrium of this preference model. We term this approach Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF).   In the context of a tabular policy representation, we present a novel algorithmic solution, Nash-MD, founded on the principles of mirror descent. This algorithm produces a sequence of policies, with the last iteration converging to the regularized Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we explore parametric representations of policies and introduce gradient descent algorithms for deep-learning architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experimental results involving the fine-tuning of a LLM for a text summarization task. We believe NLHF offers a compelling avenue for preference learning and policy optimization with the potential of advancing the field of aligning LLMs with human preferences."
Google Research,The Impact of Preference Agreement in Reinforcement Learning from Human   Feedback: A Case Study in Summarization,02-Nov-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04919v1,,"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can be used to capture complex and nuanced properties of text generation quality. As a result, the task of text summarization has been identified as a good candidate for this process. In this paper, we explore how preference agreement impacts the efficacy of RLHF for summarization. We show that sampling human preferences to include a range of annotator agreement results in (1) higher accuracy reward models and (2) alters the characteristics of quality captured. We additionally show improvements in downstream generation when using a reward model trained with a range of preference agreements. Our contributions have implications for the design of synthetic datasets as well as the importance of considering quality differentials in comparison-based data."
Google Research,RLAIF: Scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with AI   Feedback,01-Sep-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00267v2,,"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, gathering high-quality human preference labels can be a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced by Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that leverages a powerful off-the-shelf LLM to generate preferences in lieu of human annotators. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, RLAIF achieves comparable or superior performance to RLHF, as rated by human evaluators. Furthermore, RLAIF demonstrates the ability to outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the LLM preference labeler is the same size as the policy. In another experiment, directly prompting the LLM for reward scores achieves superior performance to the canonical RLAIF setup, where LLM preference labels are first distilled into a reward model. Finally, we conduct extensive studies on techniques for generating aligned AI preferences. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve human-level performance, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF."
Google Deepmind · Google Research,SLiC-HF: Sequence Likelihood Calibration with Human Feedback,17-May-2023,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10425v1,,"Learning from human feedback has been shown to be effective at aligning language models with human preferences. Past work has often relied on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which optimizes the language model using reward scores assigned from a reward model trained on human preference data. In this work we show how the recently introduced Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC), can also be used to effectively learn from human preferences (SLiC-HF). Furthermore, we demonstrate this can be done with human feedback data collected for a different model, similar to off-policy, offline RL data. Automatic and human evaluation experiments on the TL;DR summarization task show that SLiC-HF significantly improves supervised fine-tuning baselines. Furthermore, SLiC-HF presents a competitive alternative to the PPO RLHF implementation used in past work while being much simpler to implement, easier to tune and more computationally efficient in practice."
DeepMind,Improving Multimodal Interactive Agents with Reinforcement Learning from   Human Feedback,21-Nov-2022,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11602v1,,"An important goal in artificial intelligence is to create agents that can both interact naturally with humans and learn from their feedback. Here we demonstrate how to use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve upon simulated, embodied agents trained to a base level of competency with imitation learning. First, we collected data of humans interacting with agents in a simulated 3D world. We then asked annotators to record moments where they believed that agents either progressed toward or regressed from their human-instructed goal. Using this annotation data we leveraged a novel method - which we call ""Inter-temporal Bradley-Terry"" (IBT) modelling - to build a reward model that captures human judgments. Agents trained to optimise rewards delivered from IBT reward models improved with respect to all of our metrics, including subsequent human judgment during live interactions with agents. Altogether our results demonstrate how one can successfully leverage human judgments to improve agent behaviour, allowing us to use reinforcement learning in complex, embodied domains without programmatic reward functions. Videos of agent behaviour may be found at https://youtu.be/v_Z9F2_eKk4."
